## Installation

git clone https://.com/Stewpra/notes-taker.git

## Usage

The app is used by first entering the title and description of the given task. The required buttons will appear in the top left corner and the user can either clear the inputs or save the task. The task will then fill the column to the left. From there the user can select the note to either edit it or delete it. A very straight forward aproach removes any guess work and keeps study sessions productive.
